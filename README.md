## Description
    This is a homework assignment that was assigned in my first week of my coding bootcamp. The goal of this assignment was to conduct a search engine optimization process by removing all of the <div> tags and replace them with semantic HTML tags, to consolidate the style.css file, and to add comments to both index.html and to style.css.
